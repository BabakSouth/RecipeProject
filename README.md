In this evaluation, we will be focusing on assessing the candidates' software design, implementation, and testing skills. Our primary emphasis will be on evaluating the quality of the underlying coding structure, the effectiveness of the implementation, and the thoroughness of the testing process. The entire solution does not need to be unit tested. Please note that we will not be evaluating based on the aesthetics or visual appeal of the user interface.
